# Mechanimation
Animated machinery for Minecraft

Mechanimation adds in animated machines to Minecraft.  
It's heavily WIP and many aspects are not ready for use in survival mode.  
The mod's main purpose is to be used alongside Metroid Cubed 4, but many of the machines can also be used to substitute other mod's machines.
